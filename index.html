            <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>

        <a href="files/Affinity_DOC.pdf"><img src="images/Affinity_IMG.png" alt="Affinity Diagram Image"></a>
        <p>
            We sorted varying questions and problems in an attempt to formulate quality solutions for the issue of
            students being overwhelmed with options for classes to take.
            These include the problems of format, target users, school usage, and implementation methods such as mobile
            apps, websites, and other aspects such as ease of use and inclusivity.
            This resulted in an idea for an AI-powered program that recommends classes to students based on their enjoyment
            and performance in other classes.

        <a href="files/wireframe.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/sketch.png"></a>
        <p>
            Created 3 simple wireframe sketches showcasing the utility of my app, "CourseCompass". This is done through
            showing things such as account creation,
            adding classes to get personalized recommendations using AI, and finally showing how school
            administration could easily and efficiently manage students' classes
            via their phones, with personalized recommendations for each student.
