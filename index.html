            <h3>Affinity Diagram</h3>
        </a>
        <a href="files/Affinity_DOC.pdf"><img src="images/Affinity_IMG.png"></a>
        <p>
            We sorted varyings questions and problems in an attempt to formulate quality solutions for the issue of
            students being overwhelmed with options for classes to take.
            These include the problems of format, target users, school usage, and implementation methods such as mobile
            apps, websites, and other aspects such as ease of use and inclusivity.
            This resulted in an idea for a AI powered program that recommend students classes based on their enjoyment
            and performance in other classes.

            <h3>Wireframe Sketches</h3>
        </a>
        <a href="files/WireframeSketch.pdf"><img src="images/sketch.png"></a>
        <p>
            Created 3 simple Wireframe sketches showcasing the utility of my app, "CourseCompass". This is done through
            showing things such as account creation,
            adding classes to get personalized recommendation using AI, and finally showing the difference that school
            administration could use to easily and efficiently manage students classes
            via their phone, and being able to get recommendations for each and every one of their students.
