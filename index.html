            We sorted varyings questions and problems in an attempt to formulate quality solutions for the issue of students being overwhelmed with options for classes to take.
           These include the problems of format, target users, school usage, and implementation methods such as mobile apps, websites, and other aspects such as ease of use and inclusivity.
           This resulted in an idea for a AI powered program that recommend students classes based on their enjoyment and performance in other classes.
